# Baluns, and UnUns {-}

I've also been building my own Baluns and UnUns for my wire antennas. Sure, there are circumstances
with a well balanced and set up antenna where you may not necessarily need one, but, I believe that
those circumstances are probably more rare than common, and that having a Balun or UnUn in place
is more of a guarantee that you know what your antenna is at least meant to do. Ultimately I think
I just feel happier with a Balun or UnUn in place, so will continue down that line (and, I don't have
the space to use ladder line, it's all coax here, so that helps push me in that direction).

Absolutely, I believe antenna setups wtihout Baluns or UnUns are working for people, and they have
made 1000's of QSOs on those antennas. I also suspect that maybe with a Balun or UnUn those anntennas
may perform even better, or you may have less RF common mode back in your shack. But, hey, that's
up to you to decide ;-)

The world of Baluns and UnUns is full of conflicting confusing information, probably as it's actually
pretty hard to understand and is more an art and black magic sometimes than physical design. Some of
the more useful articles I've read are:

- Steve Hunt (G3TXQ) article from [RadCom Plus](https://rsgb.org/main/publications-archives/radcom-plus/)
  May 2015 titled 'High performance common-mode chokes'. I'm not sure how available that article is
  if you do not have an RSGB]() membership, so I'll leave out any direct links.
- Steve Dick (K1RF) ['THE END FED HALF-WAVE ANTENNA' deck](http://gnarc.org/wp-content/uploads/The-End-Fed-Half-Wave-Antenna.pdf)
  is full of good information, measurements, graphs and designs.
- Steve Nichols ['Using Baluns and Ununs' deck](http://www.infotechcomms.net/downloads/Baluns-and-Ununs.pdf
  is a good intro/overview with good references (including iirc the two above).

The 'holy grail' is the book ['Building and Using Baluns and Ununs'](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Jerry-Sevick/e/B001K7XQ1M/ref=dp_byline_cont_pop_book_1). No, I don't own that... yet.
