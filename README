These are the source pages for my qsl.net pages.
I don't make much use of them, now I have an active QRZ page.

You can find the final pages published at https://www.qsl.net/m7grw/

# Building

The pages are built with bookdown, which we run from docker.

First step is to get the docker image built:

$ ./dockerbuild.sh

## Doing a build

To do an actual build, you run up a shell in the docker image and execute a command:

$ ./dockerrun.sh
# cd data
# ./build.sh

That leaves the results back on the host machine in the '_build' directory.

# Uploading

I used ftp. connect to ftp.qsl.net. Username **lower case**, and normal password.
Then, as ftp does not do recursive, I did a bunch of

# mput *
# mput */*
# mput */*/*
# mput */*/*/*
# mput */*/*/*/*

Slow, but effective. A gui ftp client could do a recursive put - that might be easier if we do this a
lot.
