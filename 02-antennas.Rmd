# Antennas {-}

I used to run a long-wire made with Kevlar cable out of the 'shack' window to a tree as
a temporary receive solution, but have since managed to erect a
[2/3^rds^ G7FEK](https://www.g7fek.co.uk/software/G7FEK%20antenna.pdf), which so far is doing OK.

I like building antennas. I've constructed a number for [LoRa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LoRa)
(j-pole, yagi, 1/4 wave vertical), and VHF
([Flower pot](https://vk2zoi.com/articles/half-wave-flower-pot/), co-linear coaxial). I'm hoping
to get some experimentation done on HF as well.

One crucial piece of equipment I recently acquired was a [nanoVNA](https://nanovna.com/). I think if
you are doing anything beyond the basics with antennas then one of those is really going to be your
friend!
