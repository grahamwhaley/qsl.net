I'm learning morse. Voice and data modes don't really appeal to me at the moment. Yes, it's hard work,
but that is the challenge.

I'm currently learning using the 'Koch' method (learn at full speed, one letter at a time),
and using the 'Farnsworth' method (make the gaps between characters and words longer, but keep the
speed of the characters themselves the same) to help get my 'ear in'.

I'm using [Koch Morse Tutor](https://github.com/hmatuschek/kochmorse), mostly as I'm a Linux user.

There is a lot of information out there on learning Morse, and a lot of tools. Good luck!
